# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets-Competition
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition. The goal of the competition is to analyze and process tweets related to disasters using natural language processing techniques.

# Overview
- In this competition, participants are provided with a dataset of tweets that are labeled as either related to a disaster or not. The task is to build a model that can accurately classify new tweets as disaster-related or not. The competition encourages the use of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the text data and train a predictive model.
